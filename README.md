# FindPlayer
 A Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot plugin that can locate a player's location. This plugin utilizes a MYSQL database to store
 player's locations after they've left a Minecraft server. You can set database credentials in the config.yml file
 
 ## Commands
 Currently there are 2 commands:
 \n**/findp \[player\]** - This will return a player's coordinates, this works without a database for players who are
 currently in-game. With a database it can also return an offline player's coordinates.
 \n**/findplist** - Returns a list of all players who have joined the game since the plugin was added to the server.
 
 ## Permissions
 - FindPlayer.findp
 - FindPlayer.findplist
